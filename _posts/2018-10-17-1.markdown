Hello all,
Not very often I end up doing things that may be interesting.
Instead of rotting offline, I'll try to share them here.

Plus it might encourage people to checkout the github. I don't know yet if old stuff will be talked about but there might be useful code waiting to be dug (deep in a pile of broken shit for sure).
